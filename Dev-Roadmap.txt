Dev-RoadMap
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The document describes an intended path of development. WebDruino will have a series
of components to complete and each component exposing a new set of features. 

To ensure consitency the components and requirements for them will be placed here
with an initial timeline to have the components complete. This also allows us to manage
components and change their priorities depending on demands and requests.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

C01 - Complete Digital and Analog IO capability 	- COMPLETE
Estimate: 1 week.
  Includes the ability for webdruino server to read/write both types.
-- Update: Some cleanup left, mostly done.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Reading and writing of analog and digital is working.
-- Need proper examples and some tutorials TBA
----------------------------------------------------------------------

C02 - Completion of WebDruino protocol				- PARTIAL
Estimate: 1 week.
  Inital ASCII protocol is complete.
-- Update: Mostly done. Will add extend methods.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The protocol is complete. Although it needs documenting, and 
an extension method described (for controls and SPI etc).
----------------------------------------------------------------------

C02a - Working build for Linux and OSX				- STARTED
Estimate: 1 week.
  Need to finish repairing Network Tcp Server (removal)
  Get LuaSys working on Linux/OSX and new changes to turbo.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Started testing on Linux with new LuaSys dll. Various issues.
Windows 64 bit built ok.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  
C03 - Configuration for Digital and Analog pin assignment.
Estimate: 2 weeks.
  Closely coupled/dependent on C01 this needs to be completed ASAP.

C04 - Configuration for Arduino types
Estimate: 2 weeks.

C05 - Bug Collation and QA Pass
Estimate: 4 weeks.
  Collect bugs, set their priority and fix a percentage (Determined by their scale/impact). 
  During this time a number of QA Passes for the code and tools. These will feed into the 
  bug collection as well.
  Aim: Stabilize the code base and ensure an initial Alpha release.
  
C06 - Develop design for flexible controls
Estimate: 2 weeks.
  Design a simple mustache template system for handling controls (of almost any type) and 
  how they map to pins.
  
C07 - Develop Lua interface for the Web.
Estimate: 4 weeks.
  Allow the WebDruino interface to provide control systems for the Arduino that can be 
  sent to the devices and executed as needed. Ideally all LuaJit based. C08 is closely
  coupled to this.
  
C08 - LuaJit (simplified) OS type layer for Arduino devices.
Estimate: 4 weeks.
  A cut down LuaJit that runs basic execution of pin control on Arduino devices. It
  is expected the OS layer will be less than 12KB. Allowing up to 12KB of LuaJit 
  opcode to be executed on a Nano Arduino (one of the smallest platforms).
