WARNING: Very early development - becoming stable. Use at own risk!

Windows 32 bit and Windows 64 bit now working.
Linux 32 bit and 64 bit working.

TODO:
- Digital pins operational
- Configuration for Analog and Digital pin usage.
- Configuration for Arduino type
- Lua programming panel
- Arduino software in Code page
- Bugs 

Things to be very wary of:
- WebDruino is built for mainly locally serving an Arduino and ITS NOT COMPLETE. Dont expect too much of it to work.

Feel free to get commit request. I hope to have this fully functional in the next week.
